<p>&#8220;I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the support and encouragement your staff provided me during my rehabilitation from surgery this past year. The professional atmosphere and highly competent personnel contributed markedly to both the mental and physical aspects of my recovery.</p>
<p>I have recaptured nearly 100% of mobility and strength lost prior to and as a result of surgery, allowing me to return to a variety of activities that are physically demanding while contributing to an elevated quality of life. Without the consistent, knowledgeable support of you and your staff, this process would have been much more difficult and lengthy. Thank you for your efforts in making this challenging period both tolerable and successful.&#8221; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;When I came to you with severe sciatic pain, I held out little hope that you could help me. I had tried everything including epidural injections. You listened carefully to everything I said and guided me into a program of stretches and strengthening exercises which have not only increased the strength of my core muscles but also increased my endurance while playing sports and gardening.</p>
<p>Since leaving your care, I have been relatively pain free. I came to you on the recommendation of my back doctor who considers you one of the best in the county. Needless to say, I agree.&#8221; </p>
